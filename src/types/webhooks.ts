/**
 * Outbound webhooks — server-to-server event delivery for the public API.
 *
 * Subscribers register a URL + an event-type allowlist. Whenever a write
 * inside the sub-account emits a matching event, every subscription gets
 * its own delivery attempt, signed Stripe-style with `LeadStack-Signature`.
 *
 * Three Firestore collections:
 *   - `subAccounts/{id}/webhookSubscriptions/{subId}`
 *     One per subscriber URL. Carries the signing secret + circuit-breaker
 *     counters. Server-only writes via Admin SDK.
 *   - `subAccounts/{id}/webhookEvents/{eventId}`
 *     Append-only. One row per event emitted. Powers the "manual replay"
 *     UI in slice 8 by holding the payload long enough to re-fire.
 *   - `subAccounts/{id}/webhookEvents/{eventId}/deliveries/{deliveryId}`
 *     One row per attempt against one subscription. `attempt`, `status`,
 *     `httpStatus`, `responseBody` excerpt, `nextRetryAt`.
 *
 * `mode` mirrors API keys: a `test` subscription only fires for events
 * emitted by `test` mode API calls; `live` subscriptions never see test
 * traffic. Lets agencies preview integrations safely.

/**
 * The full event registry. Adding a new event type:

 *   2. Wire `void emitEvent(...)` into the corresponding write path
 *      (slices 4-6 do this for contacts / deals / tasks / etc).
 *   3. Document the payload shape in /docs/api (slice 8).
 *
 * Naming follows Stripe convention: `<resource>.<verb>`. `.updated` fires
 * on every PATCH; resource-specific verbs (e.g. `deal.stage.changed`)
 * fire when the change is meaningful enough that subscribers usually want
 * a finer trigger than ".updated".

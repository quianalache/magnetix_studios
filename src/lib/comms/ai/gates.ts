/**
 * Agency-level gating for the AI-agent channels. Each AI channel spends the
 * agency's shared OpenRouter credits (Voice additionally burns Vapi minutes),
 * so the agency owner controls which channels a sub-account may run — the same
 * `*EnabledByAgency` pattern the WhatsApp + Outbound Voice gates already use.
 *
 * Centralised here so the enable-time check (channels PATCH route) and the
 * runtime checks (inbound webhooks, widget config/message, Vapi LLM turn) all
 * read the SAME field per channel and can't drift.
 *
 * Default-when-undefined (legacy docs) differs by channel — see CHANNEL_GATE:
 *   - SMS / Web Chat / Inbound Voice PRE-EXISTED this gate (they were always
 *     available before gating shipped), so they default ON. Upgrading a
 *     deployment doesn't silently cut off a tenant's running bot; the gate is
 *     opt-OUT (the agency flips it off to clamp cost). Explicit `false` locks.
 *   - WhatsApp shipped gated-off from day one, so it stays opt-IN (default OFF,
 *     `=== true`).

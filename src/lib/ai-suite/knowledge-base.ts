Results show on a map and an enriched list (phone, email, website, rating); amber pins and the 'No website' filter flag businesses without a website. Tick the ones you want, optionally edit the 'Tag as' value (pre-filled from the search, e.g. 'plumbers-brisbane'), and click Import to create contacts (source 'Get Leads' plus that tag; duplicates by phone/email are skipped). Follow up using the tag: a Workflow with the 'contact created' trigger filtered to that tag, a Broadcast to that tag's audience, or an outbound voice campaign over it. Results aren't saved — import before leaving the page. It's experimental and agency-gated: if it shows 'Locked', ask your agency owner to enable it.

Bookings are phone-only: no email is collected, so no confirmation email or reminders are sent — the caller is identified by caller ID (new callers become a contact with source 'Voice'). Because nothing is emailed to the caller, every booking attempt creates a team follow-up Task after the call ends: a 'Follow up with…' task when a booking was made (a nudge to confirm the appointment with the caller), or a 'Call back…' task when a caller tried to book but the call ended before a time was locked in.

One webhook covers ONE event category — create one per category. Failed deliveries retry with backoff; 10 straight failures auto-pauses the webhook. (2) REST API: mint keys (lsk_live_/lsk_test_) under API Keys for inbound calls. Both require the agency owner to enable API access for this sub-account (a feature gate). The assistant can set up a webhook for you — just say what should trigger it and give the endpoint URL, and it sends a test event to verify it's live. n8n users: n8n shows two URLs per webhook node — the Test URL (/webhook-test/, only works while the editor is listening) and the Production URL (/webhook/, requires the workflow's Active toggle ON). Use the Production URL for permanent hooks.",

Those are all off by default. Three AI channels are ON by default and can be switched OFF per sub-account instead: SMS AI auto-reply, Web Chat AI, and Inbound Voice AI. Open a sub-account's Manage dialog and tick the gates; the same dialog also holds the per-sub-account AI model picker (which model the assistants use for that workspace). While a feature is off, its sidebar entry shows a 'Locked' badge (or is hidden if you chose hide-instead-of-lock) and its routes are blocked. Enabling resumes instantly. The Agency Assistant can flip most gates for you (the email sending domain gate must be changed in the Manage dialog because disabling it tears down the live domain).

      "Client billing lets you charge each sub-account a monthly subscription through your own Stripe account (payments land directly in your Stripe — the platform takes no cut). Create plans at Agency → Client billing: each plan is a name, a monthly price, and the bundle of feature gates it unlocks. Assign a plan from that page's Clients table or from Agency → Sub-accounts → Manage → Billing: the workspace goes 'Awaiting payment' and you can copy or email a secure checkout link (re-sending invalidates older links); the client can also pay from an in-app activation screen. When they pay, the plan's features switch on automatically and renewals bill monthly. You can set a per-client special price, switch plans on a live subscription (prorated), or mark a client 'comped' (not billed — the default for every workspace, so nothing changes until you assign a plan). If a renewal fails the client sees a payment banner for a 7-day grace period, then the workspace pauses behind a paywall until they pay — data is never deleted. The Clients table shows each client's plan, status, and your MRR. You can also bill a client ONCE (e.g. 'Web design — $500') independent of any plan: create a one-time charge from the Manage dialog's Billing section (description + amount → a secure payment link to copy or email; it works for comped clients too). The Agency Assistant can drive billing by chat — list plans, create a plan, assign a plan to a sub-account, and create a one-time charge — each write behind its own confirmation card.

      "On installable (custom-branded) deployments the app can be added to a phone's home screen or installed on desktop, and you can turn on push notifications so you're alerted the moment a lead comes in. Notifications are per-user and per-device — each person enables them on each phone or computer they use. To turn them on, open the top-right account menu → Your account → Notifications, allow notifications when the browser prompts, then pick which sub-accounts should notify you. They arrive as that device's normal system notifications — a banner or lock-screen alert in the phone's notification tray, or the computer's notification centre — delivered by the browser even when the CRM isn't open; they are NOT messages that appear inside the CRM, and tapping one opens the app to the relevant item. Because they're per-device, each phone or computer you enable gets its own alert. You'll get a push for a new lead, a new inbound conversation message, a new booking, and a missed call. iPhone and iPad only deliver web push to an app that's been added to the Home Screen (Share → Add to Home Screen), so on iOS install the app first, open it, then enable notifications from that page — the Notifications page shows this hint until you do. If it says notifications aren't configured, the deployment is missing its push keys — that's an agency-owner/setup task (set the VAPID keys NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY + VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY and redeploy).

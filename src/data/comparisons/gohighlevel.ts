          "Yes, on your timeline. Contacts import via CSV and your other records come across through the public REST API. The smooth path most agencies take: onboard new clients straight onto LeadStack, run both side by side, and move existing clients at their natural renewal. No big-bang cutover, no pressure.",

        question: "How does the white-label work?",
        answer:
          "You deploy LeadStack to your own cloud under your own domain and set your brand in one config file — name, logo, tagline, support email, pricing. Every surface your clients touch renders as your brand: the landing page, every dashboard screen, transactional emails, public booking pages, the AI chat widget, and customer-facing quote pages. The LeadStack name never appears. And each sub-account can carry its own sending domain and dedicated phone number, so your clients see fully separate brands right down to the channel.",
      },
      {
        question: "What does it actually cost to run?",
        answer:
          "After the one-time license, a small agency runs on the generous free tiers across hosting, database, and email — around the price of a cup of coffee a month. GoHighLevel is $297/month for the platform alone, forever, before add-ons. The usage you'd pay either way — SMS, email, AI — you pay your providers directly, at their published rates, without a platform markup on top.",
      },
      {
        question: "Who owns my client data?",
        answer:
          "You do — completely. Every contact, deal, conversation, and call summary lives in your own cloud project, under your billing and your access control. There's no LeadStack-controlled database in the loop, and you can export everything at any time with your database vendor's standard tools. Your clients' data is your asset, not a vendor's leverage.",

        question: "Do I need to be a developer to run LeadStack?",
        answer:
          "No code, ever — once it's deployed, the entire CRM runs in the browser. Setup is a one-time, guided process: you create a few standard provider accounts and paste in the keys, with an AI coding assistant able to walk you through every step. There's nothing to write — just accounts to connect. Budget around a couple of hours if it's your first time and this isn't something you do every day; faster if it is. After that, it's just your CRM.",

/**
 * Daily cleanup sweep for the public API's TTL'd collections.
 *
 * Replaces Firestore native TTL policies — those would require the buyer
 * to click into the Firebase console after cloning, which breaks the
 * "configure env vars, run firebase deploy --only firestore:rules, done"
 * onboarding model. This route does the same job using infrastructure
 * the buyer is already configuring (QStash).
 *
 * Wiring (one-time, in the QStash dashboard):
 *   Schedule: cron `0 4 * * *` (or any daily slot)
 *   Target:   ${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/cron/api-cleanup
 *
 * Cost: at moderate API volume (~50k requests/month) this sweep deletes
 * ~50k apiRequestLogs/month + smaller volumes of apiIdempotency and
 * webhookEvents. Total ~$0.06/month in Firestore ops — same ballpark as
 * native TTL would cost (TTL also bills 1 delete per doc).
 *
 * Continuation: if any collection hits the per-run cap, the route
 * self-schedules a re-run in 60s. Caps the function execution time well
 * under Vercel's serverless timeout and prevents tablet-hot issues from
 * batch-deleting 100k docs in one shot.

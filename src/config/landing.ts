/**
 * Landing-page configuration.
 *
 * The repo ships with two complete landing pages:
 *
 *   - "custom"    â€” a generic agency-CRM landing the buyer brands as
 *     their own. THIS IS THE DEFAULT â€” every new clone should be
 *     branded for the buyer's business, so the custom variant renders
 *     at "/" out of the box and CUSTOM_BRAND below should be edited
 *     first.
 *
 *     Wired for a DONE-FOR-YOU sales motion, not self-serve SaaS:
 *     prospects see a "Talk to us" mailto CTA (uses CUSTOM_BRAND.
 *     supportEmail), the owner takes payment off-system, provisions
 *     a sub-account, then invites the client via the in-app invite
 *     flow. Pricing tiers + section are hidden by default â€” see the
 *     CUSTOM_BRAND.pricing block below for how to re-enable real
 *     self-serve resale.
 *
 *   - "leadstack" â€” the LeadStack-branded marketing landing that sells
 *     LeadStack itself (used on the leadstack.dev demo site). Only flip
 *     back to this if you're running the public LeadStack demo.
 *
 * Flip LANDING_VARIANT below to swap which one renders at "/".

   * config below is kept as a starting point for buyers who later want
   * to enable real Stripe-driven SaaS resale. To re-enable:
   *
   *   1. In src/app/page.tsx, re-import and render <CustomPricing />
   *      (file at src/components/landing-custom/pricing.tsx).
   *   2. Re-add the "#pricing" nav link in landing-custom/navbar.tsx
   *      (desktop nav + mobile sheet).
   *   3. Wire the pricing card buttons to createCheckoutSession with
   *      the relevant STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID etc., instead of /signup.
   *   4. Un-gate the Subscription panel in the sub-account settings
   *      page (currently gated on LANDING_VARIANT === "leadstack").
   *   5. Add a Stripe-driven public signup flow that provisions a
   *      fresh agency + sub-account + owner membership on
   *      checkout.completed â€” today's /api/auth/signup is invite-only
   *      after the first bootstrap user, so strangers paying through
   *      Stripe can't currently land anywhere. See CLAUDE.md
   *      ("Auth & Tenancy Model") for the existing signup contract.
